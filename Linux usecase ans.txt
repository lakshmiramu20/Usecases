Linux Usecase:

1. Goto /home/hduser directory and Create 2 files namely cust1.txt and cust2.txt with the first 10 lines copied 
from /home/hduser/hive/data/custs and last 10 lines copied from /home/hduser/hive/data/custs.
Ans:
Correct:
head -n 10 /home/hduser/hive/data/custs > cust1.txt
cat cust1.txt

tail -n 10 /home/hduser/hive/data/custs > cust2.txt
cat cust2.txt

Wrong ans(Reference-creates file in data folder):
sed -n '1,10p' custs>>cust1.txt
cat cust1.txt

wc -l custs
sed -n '989,999p' custs>>cust2.txt

2. Create a file namely samplefile.txt using vi editor

a. Type/copy 10 lines of some content
[hduser@localhost ~]$ vi samplefile.txt

 cat samplefile.txt
 sed -n '1,10p' bashrcbkp>> samplefile.txt
 cat samplefile.txt

---------------------
b. Goto line 5 and remove line 5 to 7 using command.
:5
2dd

c. Goto last line and copy last line to first line and delete the last line manually.
Shift + g - to go to last line 
gg - first line
Y - Copy - cntrl + shift + c
p - paste 
dd - delete 
1dd - delete 1st line

d. Find for a particular word inside the file
 /word to search

e. Undo the last action you did
esc + u

redo - cntrl + r

f. Save and quit the file
esc, :wq

g. Open the file again, Delete 2 words in the last line and quit without saving
2dw
:q!


3. Merge the cust1.txt and cust2.txt in the name of custmerged.txt with cust2.txt contents first and cust1.txt 
content next.
Ans:
To merge files - use cat - cat cust2.txt cust1.txt > custmerged.txt

another option:
cp /home/hduser/cust2.txt /home/hduser/cust1.txt > custmerged.txt

4. Count the number of lines in custmerged.txt and add the count in the last line of the custmerged.txt using 
command without using vi editor.
Ans:
wc -l custmerged.txt>>custmerged.txt

another option:
wc -l cust1.txt
echo 10 >> cust1.txt
-------
cat filename | wc -l >> custmerged.txt
-------
>> - to append 
> - to create

5. Add a header as custno,firstname,lastname,age,profession in the first line of the custmerged.txt using 
command without using vi editor 
 (Hint: Think of using tempfiles, first create a temp file with header, then add data, then move tempfile to final 
filename)
Ans:
vi temp.txt ( add header)
2 files to edit
[hduser@localhost ~]$ cat temp.txt
123,custname,fname,lname,age,profession 
cat temp.txt>>custmerged.txt
cat custmerged.txt
tac custmerged.txt - tac returns the file in reverse order (last line becomes first line)

6. Find for the number of occurances of the word Pilot 
Ans:
grep -o -i Pilot custmerged.txt | wc -l
-i - case insensictive search
-o - outputs each match on a separate line

7. Find for Pilot and replace with Aircraft Pilot in the custmerged.txt (use the commmand sed -i 's/Pilot/Aircraft 
Pilot/g' custmerged.txt)
Ans: 
sed -i 's/Pilot/Aircraft Pilot/g' custmerged.txt

8. Count the number of words and lines in the custmerged.txt
Ans: 
wc -wl custmerged.txt

9. List and display only the last file created. List and display only the last but one file created in the current 
folder.
Ans: 
ls -Art | tail -n 1
ls -Art | tail -2 | head -1
-A list all files except . and ..
-r reverse order while sorting
-t sort by time, newest first

10. Copy the custmerged.txt in the name of custmeredcopied.txt retaining the timestamp of the original file in 
the copied file.
Ans: 
cp -p custmerged.txt custmergedcopied.txt
--------------------------------

11. Goto /tmp directory, staying in /tmp , create directories inside /home/hduser path as src/custdata using 
placeholder ~ , then goto /home/hduser/src/custdata, 
 then goto /home path using absolute path method, come back to /home/hduser/src/custdata using the 
respective placeholder, go to 2 levels higher using the 
respective placeholder
Ans:
cd /tmp
mkdir -p ~/src/custdata
cd /home/hduser/src/custdata
cd /home
cd -
cd ../..
~ - holds home of current user 
- - bck and forth 
. - current dir info
.. - parent 
../.. - grand parent 
/ - root directory
The -p option ensures that parent directories are created if they donâ€™t already exist

12. Copy the custmerged.txt inside the /home/hduser/src/custdata and rename the directory custdata as 
customerdata
Ans: 
cp custmerged.txt src/custdata/
mv src/custdata src/customerdata

13. Move & rename the /home/hduser/src/customerdata into the directory /tmp/custdata/process.
Ans:
mkdir /tmp/custdata
mv /home/hduser/src/customerdata/ /tmp/custdata/process/

14. Create a zerobyte file namely success inside /tmp/custdata/process
Ans: 
touch /tmp/custdata/process/success

15. Create a dir called /tmp/custdata/archive
Ans: 
cd /tmp/custdata
mkdir archive

16. compress using gzip compression the /tmp/custdata/process/custmerged.txt file and move into 
/tmp/custdata/archive
Ans:
gzip /tmp/custdata/process/custmerged.txt 
mv /tmp/custdata/process/custmerged.txt.gz /tmp/custdata/archive

16. Remove the /tmp/custdata/process directory.
Ans:
rm -r /tmp/custdata/process

17. Create a user in your name, set password as hduser, switch user to the user created, create a file inside 
/tmp directory in your name logged in your name.
Ans: 
sudo useradd laksh
sudo passwd laksh... (8 letters)
su laksh
- passwd
vi /tmp/laksh.txt

18. Remove write access for user using octal number and naming methods using chmod, try writing the file 
using vi editor
Ans:
Octal:
-rw-rw-r--. 1 laksh  laksh   0 Nov 14 08:00 laksh.txt
 chmod 464 laksh.txt
 ls -lrt
-r--rw-r--. 1 laksh  laksh   0 Nov 14 08:00 laksh.txt

Naming:
chmod u-w  laksh.txt

vi laksh.txt

19. Repeate the step 18 for other user also, you can use hduser as others here.
Ans:
chmod o-w laksh.txt

20. Create a local variable called welcomemessage="Welcome aspirants", convert it into environmental
